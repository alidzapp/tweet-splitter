Fork the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:damonbauer/tweet-splitter.git

Author your feature or bug fix. Edit files in the `src` directory, as well as `./app.html`.

npm tasks are as follows:

`npm run serve`
Start a browser-sync instance. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/app.html to see changes.

`npm run babel`
Convert ES6 -> ES5.

`npm run uglify`
Compress the babel'ed JS.

`npm run scss`
Compile SCSS -> CSS.

`npm run scss:watch`
Kick off the compilation of SCSS -> CSS whenever a `.scss` file changes. 

`npm run inline`
Replace `link` & `script src` tags with the contents of those files in HTML.


Compile your changes:

```
npm run build

Finally, commit your changes to your fork. Then, submit a pull request! I'll review, ask questions and suggest changes (if I have any). If everything looks good, I'll pull your changes in.
